# Reversi Advanced
## Project description

The aim of this project was to create an as "advanced" version of Reversi as possible within a three week timeline. However, it was closer to a two week timeline as the group also had to write a report about the project.

The group was restricted to using Java and JavaFX for the project. So choosing what languages would be relevant for the given problem wasn't a part of it.

For future work with the project, getting the online feature to work is a main priority. Furthermore cleaning up the code as it is would be a great improvement.

## How to install and run the project
The project is made in Java 19. this is therefore the recommended version for using the project.
To run the jar file for the project, opening command prompt in the same folder as the file and typing "java -jar AdvancedReversi.jar" will do so.

Additionally, it is worth mentioning that the program is optimized for use on a monitor with a 2k- or
1080p resolution with applications size at 100%.

## How to use the project
When opening the project, the user sees two buttons. One for starting a new game and
one for loading an earlier saved game. When opening up the program for the first time, 
the program will give an error if trying to lead a game running as a jar file. This is because the program
is looking for the saved game in the same folder as the jar-file itself.
If one chooses to start a new game they will first see a choice menu, where they can 
choose different skins for board pieces as well as the board itself.
Additionally board size can be chosen between three different sizes; 4x4, 8x8, 12x12. 
At last one can choose whether to play alone, play against an AI or play online(on LAN). The LAN

Once choosing a game mode, the user will be taken to a new page where the game is shown and possible to play. 
Given that the player is playing alone, a button for saving and quitting to the main menu. 
Regardless of what gamemode is chosen, when the game is over, the user will be taken 
to a win/lose/draw page were they can choose to restart.

All menus except the main menu have a button for returning to the main menu.
